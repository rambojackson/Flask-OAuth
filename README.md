# Flask-OAuth
OAuth2 is a popular authentication protocol used by many websites and applications. It allows users to grant access to their resources without sharing their credentials. In this project, we integrate OAuth2 authentication with Google, allowing users to log in with their Google accounts. This can be replicated for other accounts as well.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Flask-OAuthlib

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-oauth-google-integration.git
   ```
2. Install the requirements
3. Set up Google OAuth credentials:
  Go to the Google Developers Console.
  Create a new project.
  Enable the Google+ API for your project.
  Create OAuth client credentials (OAuth 2.0 Client IDs). Choose "Web application" as the application type and set the authorized redirect URIs (e.g., http://localhost:5000/login/authorized).
  Copy the client ID and client secret and replace the placeholders in the app.py file.
4. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access the application.

## Usage
Click on the "Login with Google" link to initiate the OAuth2 authentication process.
You will be redirected to the Google login page. Sign in with your Google account.
After authentication, you will be redirected back to the application.
You will see a message confirming that you are logged in with your Google account.
Refreshing Access Token
If the access token expires, you can manually refresh it by visiting http://localhost:5000/refresh.
